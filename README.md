# COD-D2CNet
Camouflaged Object Detection


Our manuscript (D2CNet) about COD has been accepted by IEEE TIE, and the official version of the paper should be reported on TIE's official website soon.

In addition, we are sorting out the camouflaged maps of the experiment, which will be available in the near future.
